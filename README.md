1. n = 4, sum = 10
2. The short sum function overflows for n > 255.
3. The long sum function overflows for n > 113511.
4. An overflow can be detected when the product is negative. The float factorial function overflows for n > 34.
5. The double factorial function overflows for n > 170.
6. The sum of the function should always total 1. However, for larger numbers, the values become innacurrate and decrease, with the float becoming inaccurate much faster than the double.
7. Due to small inaccuracies in the floats, the function believes 4.4 < 4.4 is true.
8. With the improved precision of a double, 4.4 < 4.4 becomes false, which is correct.
