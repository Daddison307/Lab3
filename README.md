1. n = 4, sum = 10
2. The short sum function overflows for n > 255.
3. The long sum function overflows for n > 113511.
4. An overflow can be detected when the product is negative. The float factorial function overflows for n > 34.
5. The double factorial function overflows for n > 170.
6. The sum of the function should always total 1. However, for larger numbers, the values become innacurrate and decrease, with the float becoming inaccurate much faster than the double.
7. Because the float has a different number of bits, small inaccuracies on the bit level make 4.4 < 4.4 true.
8. With the greater number of bits and improved precision of a double, 4.4 < 4.4 becomes false, which is correct.
